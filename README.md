## üé® Design & Customization Highlights

Zenith's design focuses on modern aesthetics and user comfort. A significant part of its appeal lies in its dynamic and customizable styling:

* **Global Font:** Utilizes the clean and "cozy" **Quicksand** font throughout the application for consistent readability.
* **Themed Palette:** Features a harmonious color palette that adapts beautifully between dark and light modes, with a focus on neutral text colors and cool-toned accents.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle hover animations and transitions on buttons, cards, and theme toggles for a responsive feel.
* **Unique Animated Background:** The background features 8 distinct, gradient-filled circles that subtly move across the viewport, visible through translucent content blocks. This creates a vibrant, yet non-distracting, ambiance.
* **Easily Modifiable CSS:** All major design elements are controlled via CSS variables in the `:root` and `[data-theme="light"]` selectors, making it incredibly easy for developers to:
    * Change primary, secondary, and accent colors.
    * Adjust background opacity for content blocks.
    * Modify the animated background's colors, number of circles, sizes, and animation speed.
    * Customize text shadows and borders.
