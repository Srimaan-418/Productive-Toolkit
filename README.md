## üé® Design & Customization Highlights

Zenith's design focuses on modern aesthetics and user comfort. A significant part of its appeal lies in its dynamic and customizable styling:

* **Global Font:** Utilizes the clean and "cozy" **Quicksand** font throughout the application for consistent readability and a friendly feel.
* **Themed Palette:** Features a harmonious color palette that adapts beautifully between dark and light modes, with distinct neutral text colors and cool-toned accents. The navigation bar, content blocks, and elements like dropdowns are all consistently styled across themes.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle hover animations and transitions on buttons, cards, and theme toggles for a responsive and engaging user experience.
* **Unique Animated Background:** The background features 8 distinct, gradient-filled circles that subtly move across the viewport. These circles are non-repeating and are visible through translucent content blocks, creating a vibrant, yet non-distracting, ambiance.
* **Easily Modifiable CSS:** All major design elements are controlled via well-organized CSS variables in the `:root` and `[data-theme="light"]` selectors, making it incredibly easy for developers to:
    * Change primary, secondary, and accent colors.
    * Adjust background opacity for content blocks and elements.
    * Modify the animated background's colors, number of circles, sizes, positions, and animation speed.
    * Customize text shadows, borders, and overall typography.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** Extensively used for all styling, dynamic theming, complex animations, responsive design, and custom properties (CSS variables).
* **JavaScript (Optional/Placeholder):** For interactive functionalities such as theme switching, real-time clock display, and the logic behind productivity tools like Pomodoro, BMI calculator, task management, etc. (Assumes typical front-end interactivity).
* **Google Fonts:** Utilized for importing custom typography ('Quicksand', 'Nunito Sans', 'Montserrat').
